# focus-guard: STRIDE Threat Model & Security Posture

Security analysis for **Privacy-First Webcam Phone-Distraction Monitor**.

| STRIDE Pillar | Identified Threat Vector | Severity | Mitigation Control |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Spoofing** | Forged inputs, mock sensor frames, or rogue model calls | High | Input cryptographic verification and HMAC identity tokens |
| **Tampering** | Model weight corruption, poisoned training/eval sets, payload tampering | High | SHA-256 integrity checksum verification on loaded artifacts |
| **Repudiation** | Unaudited execution traces or silent parameter modifications | Medium | Structured audit ledger logging with timestamped provenance |
| **Information Disclosure** | Memory leakage of internal activations, PII, or system telemetry | High | Automated zeroization of temporary buffers and strict schema boundaries |
| **Denial of Service** | Algorithmic complexity exhaustion (ReDoS, tensor OOM bombs) | Critical | Strict payload dimension caps, execution timeouts, and rate limits |
| **Elevation of Privilege** | Arbitrary code execution via unsafe deserialization (pickle/yaml) | Critical | Use safe loaders (safetensors, json, defusedxml) exclusively |
